# In-vivo-dopamine-dynamics
Data and code for the manuscript: Behavioral encoding across timescales by region-specific dopamine dynamics.

The Jupyter notebook *spyder_notebook_behavioural tasks.py* (python v3.7.11) loads the data from both hemispheres, converts to dF/F0, fits a linear fit to correct for photobleaching and converts to zF. It also plots the spectal energy densities of the two regions and representative traces of the different bands. See manuscript for methodological details.

The Jupyter notebook *spyder_notebook_processing+energy densities.py* contains code to plot all non-CNO figures related to behaviour.
