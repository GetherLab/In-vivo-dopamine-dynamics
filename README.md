# In-vivo-dopamine-dynamics
Data and code for the manuscript: Behavioral encoding across timescales by region-specific dopamine dynamics.

The Jupyter notebook (python v3.7.11) loads the data from both hemispheres, converts to dF/F0, fits a linear fit to correct for photobleaching and converts to zF. See manuscript for methodological details.

Image shows all mice. The grey trace indicates a mouse that was discarded on a qualitative basis due to fiber tangling. Scale bars are 10 minutes and 10 zF.
